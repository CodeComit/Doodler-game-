Doodler Game
Welcome to my first JavaScript game, the Doodler Game! 🎮 This project was built to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS by creating a fun and interactive platformer game where players guide a doodler character to jump from platform to platform.





🎯 Game Objective
The goal of the game is simple: help the doodler climb as high as possible by jumping from one platform to the next. The higher you go, the more points you earn! But be careful—if you miss a platform, the game is over.







🚀 Features
            
            -> Smooth Movement: The doodler moves left and right with smooth transitions.
            -> Infinite Jumping: New platforms continuously generate as the player climbs higher.
            -> Increasing Difficulty: As you progress, platforms may become scarcer, adding to the challenge.
            -> Scoring System: Keep track of your score as you play and aim to beat your high score.
            -> Simple Controls: Easy-to-use arrow keys for controlling the doodler's movement.
